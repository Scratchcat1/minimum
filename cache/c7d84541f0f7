The autoflight system, consisting of the autopilot and the autothrust, contains numerous operating modes that broadly fall into two categories, called “managed” and “selected.” When a “selected” mode is engaged, the autoflight systems will maintain an airspeed, vertical speed, and/or heading selected by the flight crew using the Flight Control Unit (FCU), shown above. The pilot enters a desired value by rotating the associated knob, then pulls the knob outward to engage the corresponding selected mode. For example, using the vertical speed knob to select a descent rate of 1,000 feet per minute and then pulling the knob outward will engage “Vertical Speed” mode, and the autopilot will modify the pitch of the airplane to achieve this descent rate.","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"P","text":"In contrast, in a “managed” mode the autopilot and autothrust take their cues from the flight plan programmed into the flight management guidance computer, or FMGC. Prior to departure, the pilots normally enter the waypoints and/or altitudes that they will use during the flight, and the autoflight systems can then make a complex series of inputs in order to follow this track, or to follow only the lateral or vertical component. A managed mode can be engaged by pressing the corresponding knob inward. For example, pressing the heading knob inward will engage NAV mode, which will cause the autopilot to navigate between the waypoints programmed in the FMGC.

However, Captain Grigoryan appeared dissatisfied with the rate of descent that resulted from this mode selection, prompting him to harshly exclaim, “This one here is also crazy, she’s not descending, brother, I don’t understand, you descend, [expletive] your mother.”","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"P","text":"Grigoryan then reached over and pulled the altitude knob outward to engage “Open Descent” mode, in which the autothrust locks engine power at idle while the autopilot controls pitch to achieve the selected airspeed.

On the Airbus A320, the pilots don’t normally set the specific thrust output manually; instead, the autothrust system determines how much thrust is needed to maintain the selected speed and/or flight path. The pilots can also determine the maximum power that the autothrust can command by setting the thrust levers to one of several general detents, such as cruise (CR), climb (CL), or takeoff/go-around (TOGA). That means that when the thrust levers are set to “climb,” the autothrust might apply maximum climb power if necessary, but will keep a lower power setting if not.

On the A320, moving the thrust levers to TOGA in the air causes the autoflight systems to enter go-around mode, which will compel the autopilot and autothrust to achieve the go-around speed and pitch and then fly to the pre-selected go-around altitude entered in the Flight Control Unit (FCU). This altitude is normally pre-set by the crew during the intermediate approach phase in order to make a go-around simpler. Setting the go-around altitude in the altitude window on the FCU while in “Approach” mode won’t do anything because in that mode the autopilot is taking its vertical guidance from the glideslope and not from the FCU selected altitude, but as soon as “go-around” mode is engaged, this pre-set altitude becomes active.","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"P","text":"Notably, Airbus procedures state that in the event of a go-around earlier in the approach, when the go-around altitude is close to the actual altitude, full TOGA power might be unnecessary.

The lateral channel simultaneously changed to Heading mode with the aircraft’s current heading selected.

This causes the autopilot to pitch up to climb at a pre-programmed vertical speed until reaching the FCU selected altitude, while the autothrust increases engine power to maintain the selected airspeed during the climb.

Then, when the thrust output reaches 95% of max climb, the autopilot will start pitching to maintain the selected airspeed while the autothrust maintains steady climb power. This tends to a result in a steep initial climb followed by a mellower phase. It should also be noted that when this implementation of open climb occurs less than 30 seconds after the use of the “push to level off” button, the autopilot is allowed to induce a vertical acceleration of up to 1.3 G, instead of the normal maximum of 1.15 G, resulting in a more abrupt pull-up.

The final report states that investigators were unable to determine why he selected 3,200 feet, but an independent analysis by Ladkin et al. speculates that he might have accidentally turned the knob while attempting to pull it outward to engage open climb.

Since the aircraft was still in the landing configuration with the landing gear down and the flaps set to FULL, there was so much drag on the airplane that the engine response was not quick enough to prevent a loss of airspeed when the autopilot initiated a rapid climb. Airbus design engineers had never intended for open climb to be used in the landing configuration, because a sudden climb during final approach is by definition a go-around, for which go-around mode should be used instead. Testing after the accident showed that a low energy warning was always generated when open climb was engaged in the high climb rate regime with the aircraft in the landing configuration, but engine thrust always built up fast enough to reverse the loss of airspeed without triggering any of the Airbus’s flight envelope protections, which are designed to prevent an outright loss of control. Furthermore, once 95% of max climb thrust was achieved, the autopilot would start pitching down to rein in the climb rate and maintain the selected airspeed, preventing any further speed decay.

If so, the pitch down inputs might have been an instinctive reaction to a perceived pitch up that didn’t actually exist. Alternatively, another contributing factor might have been the sudden decrease in the pitch attitude commanded by the flight director when the selected altitude was reset back to 600 meters. The appearance of the flight director command bar moving down toward the current pitch indication can subconsciously resemble the opposite motion, i.e. the current pitch indication rising toward the flight director command bar, creating an illusion of nose up movement.

Instead of applying the go-around procedure, his immediate priority was to carry out the controller’s very specific commands, without recognizing that these commands were entirely consistent with a standard go-around. As a result, he did not activate go-around mode or call for retraction of the flaps and landing gear. Then, while attempting to put the plane into a climbing right turn, he inadvertently uncovered an edge case in the A320’s flight control system, resulting in a very abrupt pitch up, a loss of airspeed, and a low energy warning when he attempted to engage “open climb.” This unexpected reaction fatally compounded his existing state of agitation, and he lost any remaining shred of situational awareness.","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"P","text":"First Officer Davtyan could have helped keep Grigoryan on track, but he was not in a position to do so because Grigoryan had left him “outside the control loop.” Grigoryan rarely, if ever called out his flight control inputs, mode changes, and parameter selections, which made it difficult for Davtyan to follow what he was doing. This was something he had always struggled with, according to his training record, which explicitly mentioned a lack of callouts during his A320 type rating evaluation.

However, he now found himself flying the plane by hand without the situational awareness to do so safely. Within seconds after taking control, he began to make nose down inputs with his side stick, even though the flight director was telling him to pitch up. The possible reasons for this behavior were discussed earlier in this article, but generally speaking, there’s no evidence that the inputs were associated with a conscious desire to achieve a particular flight path. Similarly, Captain Grigoryan’s increasingly heavy rudder inputs also most likely represented an involuntary stress reaction in a situation where he had lost his sense of control and was reverting to deeply ingrained behaviors from his early days flying the An-2 biplane.","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"IMG","text":"Some cabin furnishings and seats were found floating on the surface.

His lack of commentary, even as he was making large and chaotic flight control inputs, is a classic symptom of a loss of situational awareness, perhaps compounded by panic. Furthermore, despite numerous indications that they were descending, he made no attempt to correct their trajectory until he heard the ground proximity warning. All of this suggests that he was experiencing attentional tunneling onto one particular parameter, and the investigators believed that parameter was probably airspeed. The overspeed alarm prompted him to call for retraction of the flaps, but he apparently never correlated this warning with his own nose down inputs, which were causing their speed to increase.","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"P","text":"Meanwhile, First Officer Davtyan was also probably feeling a mounting sense of panic as multiple alarms blared and their flight path became irregular. But he too apparently never realized that they were descending, and during the last phase of the flight his focus was on their bank angle, despite the GPWS urging them to “pull up.” His haphazard attempts to correct their bank angle inadvertently added to Grigoryan’s pitch down, and prevented the captain from pulling out of the dive when he finally reacted to the GPWS.","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"P","text":"Tragically, investigators calculated that the crash could have been avoided at almost any point if the pilots had worked together to execute the terrain escape maneuver by applying TOGA power and pulling their side sticks fully backward.

During the orbit, the crew lost sight of the runway and became disoriented, prompting a go-around from an unusual position. During the go-around, the captain made inappropriate nose down inputs and lost awareness of the aircraft’s orientation and energy state.

But throughout most of the flight, the pilots didn’t display this kind of disciplined, careful attitude; in fact, their behavior was uncoordinated and lacked conscientiousness.

The BEA wrote, first of all, that it was a clear violation to instruct an international flight to go around due to weather conditions below minima, when ICAO rules clearly state that this responsibility lies with the captain; and second, transmitting “turn right, climb 600” instead of “go around” was an inappropriate instruction to any aircraft. Furthermore, they argued, had the controller treated flight 967 in an appropriate manner, the flight crew may not have lost situational awareness because they would have had to formulate a course of action themselves instead of blindly complying with the controller’s instructions without analyzing the implications.
