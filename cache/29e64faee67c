At issue was the turboprop commuter plane’s ability to handle atmospheric icing, a danger that has bedeviled aviators since the dawn of flight. In fact, American Eagle flight 4184 was ripped from the sky without warning after a buildup of ice induced a terrifying control anomaly that came to be known as “aileron hinge moment reversal,” which sent the aircraft rolling into an inverted dive in a matter of seconds. The questions raised were far-reaching, from the adequacy of aircraft certification, to the underappreciated hazards of freezing rain, to the controversial question of whether the accident could have been prevented, and by whom. Did ATR know that its plane had a hidden flaw? Did American and French authorities ignore warnings before the deadly crash? Could the pilots have avoided the disaster? And most of all, was the ATR safe? The debate over these issues formed the centerpiece of a far-reaching drama involving complex technical analysis, multiple fatal accidents, and countless close calls stretching from 1986 to the present day. Pieced together from official documents, books, and expert interviews, this is the story of what really happened in the years, hours, and minutes leading up to that fateful moment over Roselawn, Indiana — a moment whose echoes still reverberate three decades later.","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"P","text":"◊◊◊","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"IMG","text":"An American Eagle ATR 72–212, N288AM, sister ship of the accident airplane N401AM.

The end of price controls caused legacy airlines to abandon many shorter routes and smaller cities that could not be profitably served by their all-jet fleets, which opened up a niche for new regional airlines that filled the gap with smaller, cheaper turboprops. Simmons Airlines got its start in the town of Marquette in Michigan’s sparsely populated Upper Peninsula, where it flew a fleet of 5-passenger Piper Aerostars. The airline grew rapidly, incorporating larger aircraft such as the Embraer EMB-120 and the Short 360, until in 1986 it acquired the brand new ATR 42, a 48-passenger high-wing turboprop manufactured by the newly created French-Italian consortium Avions de Transport Regional (ATR). In 1991, the airline upsized again, adding the updated ATR 72, a stretched version of the ATR 42 with a higher passenger capacity.

As 64 passengers boarded the ATR 72, the pilots would have been reviewing the dispatch paperwork, which included the latest weather reports for their route and destination. Conditions were not substantially different than they had been three hours earlier. En route aerodromes were reporting various levels of rain, fog, low overcast, and gusty winds. The forecast summary prepared by American Airlines indicated that rain would continue into the night, associated with the passage of a cold front, and that scattered thunderstorms were possible. The freezing level was reported to be near 10,000 feet. The National Weather Service had not issued any SIGMETs, short for significant meteorological information, which would have indicated particularly adverse conditions.","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"P","text":"The NWS had issued an AIRMET (airman’s meteorological information) forecasting light to moderate turbulence and icing in clouds below 19,000 feet in northern Indiana and Illinois, but Simmons Airlines didn’t normally include AIRMETs in its dispatch package.

Snow, sleet, and other freezing precipitation with a high water content can adhere to the aircraft in flight if the temperature is within the “sticky” band stretching from approximately -20˚C to +5˚C. The resulting ice buildups can have a number of deleterious effects, including but not limited to reduced propeller efficiency, increased weight, and decreased lifting capacity of the wings. As a result, all transport aircraft are equipped with anti-icing systems that protect critical areas such as the windscreen, propellers, and external sensors. Turboprop aircraft are also typically equipped with rubber deicing boots inside the leading edges of the wings, which inflate cyclically to crack and remove any ice accumulations. But while these systems are effective, they are imperfect, and flight in icing conditions requires increased crew awareness in order to identify any negative performance changes. The fact that the crew of flight 4184 wasn’t provided with any information about the forecast icing conditions was therefore less than ideal. However, “light to moderate” conditions are by definition within the capabilities of transport category aircraft, so even if the information had been provided, it probably wouldn’t have altered the flight crew’s decision-making as they prepared for departure.","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"P","text":"◊◊◊","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"P","text":"At 14:14, just a few minutes behind schedule, flight 4184 pushed back from the ramp, ready to taxi.

I could not confirm whether that has any significance to this story. On the other hand, it is significant that the coverage of the ATR’s deicing boots was supposedly much smaller than average. A deicing boot is inherently inefficient in that it cannot have a perfectly smooth transition with the rest of the wing, which means that the highest performance wing is one without a deicing boot. As you hopefully recall, ATR had designed its aircraft with a high performance wing that was very sensitive to small disruptions, which presented a problem when it came to the deicing boots. Not having any obviously wasn’t an option, so ATR instead designed a deicing boot that protected only the forwardmost 5% of the wing chord, which apparently mitigated most of the negative aerodynamic effects. (On the stretched ATR 72, this was increased to 7%, which is still very low.) This was not anticipated to be a major issue because ice buildups produce more adverse effects the closer they are to the leading edge of the wing, and because that is precisely the area where the most ice tends to accumulate, since it points into the wind. Therefore, even a small deicing boot should be almost as effective as a much larger one, while also preserving the full aerodynamic capabilities of the wing — at least in theory.

An aerodynamically perfect surface will balance itself as long as the airflow over both sides is equal and constant, but this is real life, so in practice additional stabilizing measures are needed. On hydraulic controls, the sheer power of the hydraulic actuator forces the control surface to remain in the neutral position when it’s not moving, which makes these types of surfaces extremely stable. However, because the ATR’s ailerons are unpowered, their stability comes from two main mechanical and aerodynamic sources instead. First, the control horns contain balance weights that help dampen any undesired movement of the ailerons. And second, ailerons are inherently quite well balanced due to their fundamental design. In order to turn the plane, the aileron on the “down” wing deflects up and the aileron on the “up” wing deflects down, and both ailerons are connected to each other by control cables that run through the pilots’ control wheels. Therefore, one aileron cannot deflect down without the other simultaneously deflecting up, and vice versa. This tends to cause forces on the ailerons to cancel each other out, returning both ailerons to neutral when no inputs are being made.

This separation creates a turbulent low pressure area between the upper wing surface and the predominant airflow above. At the same time, airflow over the bottom of the wing remains attached to the lower surface, creating a pressure differential that draws the aileron upward.

However, ATR ultimately settled on a design that would not experience hinge moment reversal until the AOA reached 25 degrees. This is not only above the stall AOA, but above the stick pusher AOA, meaning that even if the airplane stalls, the stick pusher should intervene to reduce the angle of attack before the hinge moment reversal threshold is reached.

Furthermore, since aileron hinge moment reversals were associated with stalls, this feature would theoretically protect against the phenomenon even with ice on the wings.

Between 3,000 and 5,000 feet, a temperature inversion created below freezing temperatures, causing the raindrops to become supercooled. The aircraft spent nearly 12 minutes within the freezing rain band, but the pilots did not perceive any ice accumulation on the aircraft and did not activate the deicing boots. As the pilots decelerated in preparation to extend the landing gear, the aircraft suddenly stalled without warning at an airspeed of 157 knots. The autopilot disconnected and the aircraft rolled 80 degrees to the left, then all the way back to 60 degrees right. According to the New York Times, the pilots recalled the recent ATI accident, correctly identified the upset as an icing-induced stall, and executed a successful stall recovery maneuver by pitching the nose down, leveling the wings, and increasing engine power.

In principle, this rule is reasonably sound, because the autopilot can often mask deteriorating aircraft performance due to ice until the effect becomes so large that it can no longer compensate, at which point the autopilot clicks off and the pilots are suddenly handed a barely controllable airplane. This would later be identified as one of the major causes of the 1997 crash of Comair flight 3272. Pilots can avoid this undetected deterioration by hand-flying the aircraft, allowing them to feel changes in performance. However, some pilots, including Stephen Frederick, objected to the rule based on reasoning that’s worth considering.

The system was mandated by the French DGAC with an installation deadline of October 1st, 1989, and the FAA followed suit with a corresponding AD.

This contradiction appears multiple times in their report. In that very document, the BEA stated that vortex generators were installed after the Mosinee incident to help maintain “lateral control and stability” with an asymmetric ice buildup, and in another location the report states, regarding Mosinee, that “At that time… it was concluded that such conditions could have been the origin of an aileron hinge moment modification which occurred about the stall threshold….” In fact the BEA freely acknowledged that a “hinge moment modification” was observed in Mosinee and Burlington at several points in the report. It’s therefore quite transparent that the BEA was engaging in semantics — there is no meaningful difference between discovering an ice-induced “hinge moment modification” and a “hinge moment reversal,” except for the name.

He noted that according to the Simmons Airlines flight crew operating manual, a hold in icing conditions lasting more than a few minutes was required to be conducted at or above a speed called icing VmHBO, or high bank operations maneuvering speed. Basically, the ATR has two autopilot settings, high bank and low bank, which limit the amount of bank the autopilot can use while turning the aircraft to 25 degrees or 15 degrees, respectively. The icing VmHBO is the minimum speed that must be maintained in order to safely use the high bank setting in icing conditions, accounting for the fact that ice and bank angle both increase the stall speed.

Unable to comprehend this bizarre control behavior, Gagliano was not ready for this deflection either, and the plane embarked on a spectacular 450-degree right roll before he managed to regain lateral control a second time, holding the bank angle at 144 degrees. But as the pilots fought, disoriented and terrified, against control forces far outside anything they had previously encountered, they both pulled the nose up while upside down, sending the plane into a rapid dive toward the ground from 6,000 feet. The pitch angle peaked at 73 degrees nose down, at which point the flight path became unrecoverable. At that point the aileron hinge moment reversal ceased and never recurred, allowing Gagliano to roll back to wings level by about 2,500 feet.

Additionally, the BEA included a graph of aileron deflection on a common timescale with angle of attack, and there is a remarkable correlation between the two. In general, the higher the AOA, the greater the right-wing-down aileron deflection, and the only time the ailerons were able to reach the neutral or left-wing-down positions was when the AOA was below 5 degrees — that is, below the hinge moment reversal AOA.

Prior to Roselawn, the small size of the deicing boots also likely contributed. Stephen Frederick has suggested, without evidence, that the composite materials used in the wing might be more susceptible to ice accretion because they have poorer heat transfer than aluminum and might get colder in flight.

At least five fatal accidents have occurred involving the Fokker F28 and its stretched successor, the Fokker 100, due to this vulnerability. In all cases, the aircraft was improperly deiced before departure, stalled on takeoff prior to stick shaker activation, lost roll stability, and crashed. In fact, this category of jets tends to roll wildly during a stall even without ice contamination, and this behavior has been observed in multiple accidents involving the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 and the Canadair CRJ series as well.

MAK files revealed that in 1971, an Antonov An-12 turboprop crashed in the USSR after encountering icing that induced an aileron hinge moment reversal. According to the accident narrative, the ailerons suddenly deflected to the left limit; the pilots countered and managed to return the control wheel to neutral with considerable force but were unable to keep it there. The ailerons subsequently moved past neutral, at which point the hinge moment reversed to the opposite extreme, and the ailerons slammed to full right-wing-down. The aircraft lost control and crashed, killing all 7 people on board.

It’s difficult to objectively determine the extent of the phenomenon because the crash of American Eagle flight 4184 led to the publicization of a large amount of information about ATR incidents that is not available for other aircraft types. For its part, ATR did claim that its engineers managed to replicate a less severe hinge moment reversal using ice ridges on the Saab 340 and Fokker F27.","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"P","text":"Another way to look at the relative safety of the ATR is through the lens of accident rates. In total, there have been six fatal accidents involving the ATR 42 and 72 related to icing, not including the Voepass crash, which is more than any other comparable turboprop. But then again, more ATRs have been built than Saab 340s, or de Havilland Canada DHC-8s, or in fact anything else in the same category. If 500 Saab 340s and 2000s have been built, vs 1,700 ATR 42s and 72s, and the Saab has had one fatal icing accident and the ATR has had 6, does that make the Saab safer in ice or is the outcome just random? With only one data point in Saab’s column, it’s not really scientifically possible to say.","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"P","text":"It is definitely possible to say that, qualitatively, the ATR appears to be more severely affected. But then we’re back to the question of why, and it’s still not obvious what it is about the ATR that’s different from other comparable turboprops. And what if we acknowledge that the six ATR icing accidents have three different causes? Three of them were caused by stalls following a prolonged loss of speed in icing conditions. Two were caused by ground icing leading to a stall on takeoff, which can bring down (and has brought down) a wide range of aircraft. And the last one was Roselawn. So is there even one factor behind all these accidents, or is it all just a big coincidence?","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"P","text":"One possibility is that the ATR is simply more popular among shoestring airlines with shakier training and lax company cultures. Out of all the large turboprops on the market today, the ATR is the cheapest to buy and the most cost effective per seat, making it attractive for airlines that have limited cash. Many of these airlines are located in parts of the world where severe icing is less common, and their pilots are not always aware of the magnitude of the danger. A lack of respect for a multifaceted hazard could be a common factor behind multiple icing accidents with seemingly disparate causes. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that many ATRs routinely operate in cold environments without incident. Finnair, for instance, has operated ATRs practically since they were introduced and has never had a serious incident. Granted, temperatures in places like Finland are frequently too cold for ice to stick to an aircraft, but icing conditions are still relatively common there and the lack of incidents is probably because Finnish pilots are exposed often enough to be sufficiently afraid.","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"P","text":"In an ideal world, no pilot or passenger should have to fear for their safety in icing conditions. The recent expansion of certification requirements to include freezing rain is one step toward that ideal. But for the foreseeable future, mother nature will continue to hold the upper hand.

The miracle of flight does not forgive these qualities — not in pilots, not in manufacturers, and not in regulators. One cannot observe an anomaly, no matter how seemingly minor, and leave it unexplained simply because it didn’t matter this time — because next time, it might, and then it will be too late. And because of that careless indifference, flight 4184 rode headlong into the valley of death, and 68 souls were lost, having been ripped from the sky as though by an invisible hand, and yet it was not the hand of god, but the hands of real people who possessed the power to change some small thing for the better, and did not do so.
