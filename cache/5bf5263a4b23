Shocked New Zealanders feared that a disaster involving passengers had been narrowly avoided, but as it turned out, the cause of the crash was unique to the nature of training flights in particular — a fascinating fault that reared its head during a high-stakes takeoff. Investigators discovered that when the training captain attempted to simulate the failure of engine 4 just moments before liftoff, the engine actually went into reverse, dragging the plane back to earth before it had a chance to gain speed and altitude. At question were both the instructor’s technique and the design of the DC-8’s power levers, which interacted in just the right way to give the trainee pilot a much more serious emergency than he bargained for. The findings revealed a previously unknown design flaw and represented an early investigative foray into the field of cockpit ergonomics — but the story of Air New Zealand’s forgotten first disaster also provides an interesting opportunity to discuss some of the ways that aircraft design and operation have dramatically changed in the nearly six decades since.","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"P","text":"◊◊◊","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"IMG","text":"A poster depicting a 1940s-era TEAL flying boat.

For this reason, the thrust reversers on the JT3D engine reversed the direction of thrust in two separate locations, one for the exhaust and one for the bypass air. When the pilot selected reverse thrust, the fan cascade doors would open to divert bypass air forward, while the primary cascade sleeve, which surrounded the aft portion of the engine, translated rearward to expose the primary cascades.

Additionally, Douglas determined that for every degree of bank toward the reversed engine, Vmca would increase by a further 3 knots, causing the aircraft to effectively dig its own grave. But even these calculations were conservative, since they assumed the engine was at reverse idle, when in fact it would have initially generated considerably greater reverse thrust than this, since the DC-8’s engines required 14 seconds to spool down to idle from takeoff thrust.

Snapping the power lever back rapidly with the knob grasped between the thumb and forefinger, they were astonished to observe that sometimes — but not always — the motion imparted sufficient momentum to the thrust brake lever that it continued upward into the reverse detent due to inertia as soon as the power lever slammed into the flight idle stop.","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"P","text":"If the pilot grasped the knob in the normal fashion, enclosing it in their fist, then the above scenario couldn’t occur because the pilot’s fingers would prevent the thrust brake lever from rising far enough to trigger the reverser. However, McLachlan might have thought that he had somehow caught the thrust brake lever with his hand, causing it to deploy — in which case he might have thought he could mitigate the risk by grasping the spoiler disarm extension, which was farther from the thrust brake lever. Unfortunately, investigators found that triggering the №4 reverser while holding the spoiler disarm extension was actually even easier.","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"P","text":"Having discovered that it was possible to inadvertently deploy a reverser simply by moving a power lever too quickly, AIB investigators recognized that immediate action was necessary to prevent a recurrence.

Although he couldn’t have known the true danger of snapping the power lever back, it was also true that there was no compelling reason to do so. Investigators noted that a jet engine always takes the same amount of time to spool down, approximately 14 seconds in the case of the JT3D, regardless of how quickly the power lever is moved. However, on earlier piston engine airplanes, the speed with which one closed the throttles did influence the speed of the engine shutdown, and instructors had long considered a quick shutdown more realistic. Although McLachlan flew much of his career on piston aircraft, he should in principle have known that the old logic did not apply to a jet. The AIB therefore dismissed the possibility that he could have been mistaken about the effectiveness of his technique, although the possibility can’t be entirely ruled out. Instead, the AIB preferred the hypothesis that he took action rapidly due to the difficulty of timing the engine failure within the 3 second interval between V1 and VR. Additionally, he might have moved the power lever quickly to minimize the chance that the trainee would see which lever he had selected.","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"P","text":"◊◊◊","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"IMG","text":"The burnt-out passenger cabin, where firefighters rushed to save passengers, only to find none.

During the simulated engine failure, Captain McLachlan snapped the power lever back to idle too quickly, causing the thrust brake lever to rise into the reverse detent.

An incident reported now can save lives in the future, even if seemingly minor — and to be clear, this one was not minor.

If such a design flaw had escaped notice in 2024, forgiveness would not come so easily. But in 1958, when the DC-8 entered service, manufacturers’ understanding of cockpit ergonomics was a mere shadow of what it is today, and even more egregious errors were far from uncommon. In my previous article on Air Canada flight 621, I discussed how the DC-8 flight manual mentioned a system that would prevent the spoilers from being deployed in the air, even though no such system actually existed — a truly inexplicable error.

A modern aircraft could have been designed to detect the deployment of a reverser after the wheels left the ground, and the reverser could have been stowed automatically. Such a system, which was not envisioned in the AIB report, could have prevented this accident, since the deployed №4 reverser was not intended for in-flight use. Modern regulations require that once a jet aircraft is airborne, it should not be possible for a reverser to be in a deployed condition, regardless of the position of the corresponding cockpit control, unless in-flight deployment is intended as part of the design.","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"IMG","text":"Another Air New Zealand DC-8 takes off past the wreckage of its sister ship.

Ultimately, efforts to reduce training accidents have succeeded, but the determining factor was the availability of advanced simulators. As I discussed earlier in this article, in airline operations, engine failures after V1 are no longer practiced in the real aircraft. But there has also been a change in attitude among instructors and trainees alike. In 1966, a training exercise like the one in this story would have been aimed primarily at “testing” the cadet — to find out whether they were made of the “right stuff,” so to speak. Instructors did not necessarily feel that their role was to help the trainee achieve the expected standards, but rather to challenge the trainee to rise to those standards themselves. This sounds good enough on paper, but in reality it results in worse training outcomes and exposes flight crews to unnecessary risk. The modern viewpoint is that cadets should not fear training, but should treat it is a positive experience that imparts positive knowledge and skills, while the instructor’s job is to cultivate that experience. An exercise such as an engine failure after V1, if it were attempted today, would not be a complete surprise, but would be briefed beforehand in order to reduce risk and ensure the appropriate training outcome.","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"P","text":"◊◊◊","metadata":null,"markups":[]},{"type":"IMG","text":"Firefighters tackle the blaze near the DC-8’s tail.

The industry no longer considers it acceptable to expose pilots to such elevated risks in the name of preparedness when safer options exist. But these modern practices were built on lessons learned from tragedies like this one, which faded quickly from the headlines, if they ever appeared there at all, to be preserved only in the memories of those who were there, and in official reports lingering in public archives.
